IC 555 Timer in Astable, Monostable, and Bistable Modes PCB Design.

Description:
This project demonstrates the working of the IC 555 timer in all three common configurations:

- Astable mode: Generates a continuous square wave signal.
- Monostable mode: Produces a single pulse when triggered.
- Bistable mode: Works like a flip-flop (ON/OFF toggle).

Each mode is simulated and PCB-designed using Proteus 8 Professional.

Components Used:
- IC 555 Timer  
- Resistors & Capacitors
- Push Buttons  
- LED Indicators  
- Power Supply  
- Ground
